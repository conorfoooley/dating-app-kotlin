## ATTENTION
I've tired to follow facebook new policies each 3 months and appeal my app on review to enable facebook login. I don't give a shit how facebook being so stupid so they can't test my app. So, facebook login will not work anymore, I don't want to support this feature in my app. It is easy to migrate to Google login, so you can use it for sure.

**Dating app (tinder-clone).**
