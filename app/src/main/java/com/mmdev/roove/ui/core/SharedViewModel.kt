/**
 * In general, you should strongly prefer passing only the minimal amount of data between destinations.
 * For example, you should pass a key to retrieve an object rather than passing the object itself,
 * as the total space for all saved states is limited on Android.
 * If you need to pass large amounts of data,
 * consider using a ViewModel as described in Share data between fragments.
 *
 * @see https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-pass-data
